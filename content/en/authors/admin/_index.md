I am a tenured associate professor in the College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Fudan University now. Before that, I was a pre-tenured associate professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University and the director of <span style="color: #0cc977; font-weight: bold;">Nebula AI Group (NAIG)</span>. Before I joined Fudan, I got a PhD degree in computer science from the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Professor Yizhou Yu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/). I received an MS degree in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2015 and a BS degree in Optical Information Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012.

<span style="color: #0cc977; font-weight: bold;">NAIG</span> focuses on developing edge-cutting theories and technologies in AI. Our team focuses on three sub-research areas: computer vision and machine learning, embodied intelligence for humanoid robots, and AI fundamentals and applications.

- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;">Computer Vision and Machine Learning:</span> We study metric learning, weakly supervised learning, few-shot learning, meta learning, and their applications with computer vision. Our goal is building learning systems capable of understanding our visual world.
- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;">Embodied Intelligence for Humanoid Robots:</span> We aim to build a digital brain for humanoid robots, enabling them to perceive, learn, reason, make decisions, plan, and control their bodies and external objects just like humans. Our goal is to integrate intelligent services into daily life through robots.
- <span style="color: #E40B07; font-weight: bold;"> AI Fundamentals and Applications:</span> NAIG also focuses on the evolution of foundational AI theories and algorithms, while striving to develop new cognitive computing architectures. Additionally, we aim to leverage AI to accelerate research in fundamental disciplines such as protein structure analysis and drug discovery.

<font color=red>**I am currently recruiting talented Ph.D. students (for both academic and engineering) as well as Master's students (for both academic and engineering). Doctoral students will be co-supervised with [Professor Tao Xie@PKU/FDU](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1084/1713.htm). If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.**</font>
